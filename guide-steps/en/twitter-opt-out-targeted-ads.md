How to minimise targeted ads on social media: Twitter

# Body #

Twitter plays an increasingly important role as a space facilitating democratic engagement, debate and dissent. However, Twitter's track record in relation to protecting people's data has in [some instances](/node/3251) fallen short of expectations. In August 2019, for example, Twitter [revealed](/node/3111) that it had shared with advertisers the data of users who had opted-out of personalised ads. More recently, Twitter admitted that data which had been given by users for safety security purposes had been ["inadvertently" used for advertising purposes](https://help.twitter.com/en/information-and-ads).

Here's how you can minimise ad targeting by Twitter.
