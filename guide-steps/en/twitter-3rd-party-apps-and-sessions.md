# Title
Twitter - 3rd Party apps and sessions

# Summary
Like many big platforms, Twitter can be used with different apps and paired with 3rd services, offering an insight into your account. In this guide, we look at how to keep a tight control over 3rd party access to your account.

# Body
You might sometimes connect from a device that is not yours, for example someone else's computer. We recommend you always log out after doing so, but if you forgot, you can view all active sessions in *Account > Apps and sessions*

![Access your current sessions](../../images/Twitter/tw_browser_apps_session_1.png?raw=true)

Here, you should remove all the sessions you don't recognise by clicking the **Revoke access** button next to it. If you are doing this from the only device where you use twitter, you can safely click **Log out all other sessions**.

We also recommend you check the apps with access to your account and remove all the apps you don't recognise.
