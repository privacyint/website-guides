# Title
A guide to getting your data from the X App

# Summary
Your X app generates a lot of data about you. Here we show you how to gain access to it.

# Body

The information you (consciously or not) share with X can be very revealing. It can also be (mis)interpreted by government agencies and used to profile individuals. Once installed on a device, depending on your settings, the X app may have access to information such as your location, contact information and media stored on the same device. All of this data can be potentially be accessed remotely using cloud extraction technology.

This guide shows you how to obtain the data X stores about you and to limit the amount of data being collected.

**How to find out what data Twitter stores about you**
