## Phone number

Telegram requires a phone number to create an account. By default, this phone number will be visible by your Telegram contacts. If you have given Telegram access to your contact books when creating your account, this means all these contact will be able to see your phone number and know that you are using Telegram. To avoid this behaviour, you can set the visibility to `Nobody` so that even the people in your contact book will only be able to see your Telegram handle and not your phone number. We recommend this as it also prevent strangers from finding you on Telegram via your handle (the `@username`) and seeing your phone number.

### Last seen & online

This setting lets you control if other people can see when you last used Telegram, and if you saw their message. We suggest you set to `Nobody` to avoid leaving traces about your phone usage.


### Profile photo

We recommend not using a real photo of you, and setting the visibility to `My contacts`. If using a real photo, make sure all your contacts are trustworthy.

### Two-step verification

Adding a cloud password adds an extra layer of security when logging in to your account. This will prevent anyone that has access to your SIM card from accessing your account without your knowledge. Tap **Settings > Privacy and Security > Two steps verification**. You will be required to enter this password whenever you login a new device. Make sure you use a unique password!

### Active sessions

If your account is linked to a device that may be compromised (e.g. a lost phone), you should terminate its session so that it no longer has access to your Telegram account. To do so, go to `Active sessions`, and there choose the device on which you want to terminate the session. In this page, you can also set a time limit for inactive sessions so that they are terminated automatically.

### Delete my account

If you use Telegram on a regular basis you can set your account to delete itself and all of its content if you are unable to access your account from all linked devices for some reason (e.g. natural disaster). If you want to avoid your conversations from being accessed should you not be able to connect for a certain time, you might want to consider setting this option to 1 or 3 months.
