Adjusting Google account settings to protect your privacy

# Summary #
Google provides you with several options to protect the privacy and security of your account. However, most of them are not enabled by default. In this guide we'll take you through some of these options so you can adjust your Google account settings to protect your privacy and minimize tracking.

# Body #
Google is enormous and is expert at accumulating data. Its main source of revenue is advertising. The company dominates web search, has a dominant web browser Chrome, owns YouTube (and many other companies) and is the designer/develop of Android, the operating system that runs on nearly 75% of global smart phones.

To find the settings page for your account, either navigate to [this link][1], or open the Google app on your mobile device. If you use Android, you can also find this option in the Settings app.

Once you're on the account settings page, open the **Data and privacy** tab. In this screen, you can control how and with whom your data is shared. To better protect your privacy you can restrict Google from sharing and analysing your data as much as possible.

You can scroll down to **History settings** and disable data collection for **Web & App Activity**, **Location History**, and **YouTube History**. This possibly prevents your data from being shared with Google and their third parties.

Then, scroll down to **Data from apps and services that you use**. Under **Third-party apps and services**, you can see the apps on your phone that can access your Google account data. Ideally, this list would be empty.

Finally, you can go on **Personalised ads** and disable **My Ad Centre** and the options in **Partner Ads Settings**. You can also disable **Personal results in Search**, so that Google will not use your account data to tailor your search results. This prevents Google and their partners from serving you [targeted advertisements][2] based on your account data.

If you have a Google Fit device, you can adjust its privacy settings under the **Google Fit privacy** section. Click on **Manage Google Fit privacy** and make sure to disable any data sharing or personalization.
