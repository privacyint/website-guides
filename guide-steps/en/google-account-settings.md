Google dominates online search. The company also owns YouTube and Android, with the latter [reportedly](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/iphone-vs-android-market-share-3691861/) making up nearly 75% of the global smart phone market share. We have [written](/node/2293) about the numerous problems that come from corporate concentration and the use of data by monopolistic companies, and there are numerous [examples](https://privacyinternational.org/corporateabusetimeline?tid=442) of Google's failure to protect its users. In this guide, we provide you with suggestions to help you protect the privacy of your Google account.

To find the settings page for your account, either navigate to [this link](1), or open the Google app on your mobile device. If you use Android, you can also find this option in the Settings app.

Once you're on the account settings page, open the **Data and privacy** tab. In this screen, you can control how and with whom your data is shared. To better protect your privacy, you should disable Google from sharing and analysing your data as much as possible.

Scroll down to **History settings** and make sure to disable data collection for **Web & App Activity**, **Location History**, and **YouTube History**. This prevents possibly sensitive information from being shared with Google and their third parties.

Then, scroll down to **Data from apps and services that you use**. Under **Third-party apps and services**, you can see the apps on your phone that can access your Google account data. Ideally, this list should be empty.

Finally, find the **Personalised ads** and make sure to disable **My Ad Centre** and the options in **Partner Ads Settings**. Make sure to also disable **Personal results in Search**, so that Google will not use your account data to tailor your search results. This prevents Google and their partners from serving you [targetted advertisements](2) based on your account data.

If you have a Google Fit device, you can adjust its privacy settings under the **Google Fit privacy** section. Click on **Manage Google Fit privacy** and make sure to disable any data sharing or personalization.
