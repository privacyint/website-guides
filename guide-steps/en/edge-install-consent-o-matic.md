Install an automatic consent pop-up filler on Microsoft Edge - Consent-O-Matic

# Summary #
Consent-O-Matic is a browser add-on used to automatically answer consent pop-ups for you, according to your privacy preferences. In this guide, you'll learn how to install Consent-O-Matic on Microsoft Edge.

# Body #
In some locations, websites are required by law to ask you for consent if they want to collect data that can be used to track you. This has become a general practice across the web, and the typical way to ask for consent is by using banners, sometimes with sketchy options to misguide you into giving consent. Consent-O-Matic is a browser add-on that allows you to set your privacy preferences, and then fills in consent forms automatically for you according to those preferences. This way, you ensure your privacy preferences are preserved while browsing the web, without the need to manually parse and fill consent forms.

This guide explains how to install Consent-O-Matic on Microsoft Edge.

### Installation ###
Like any other add-on, install Consent-O-Matic by visiting the [Chrome web store][1]. Then, select **Allow extensions from other stores** in the banner at the top of the page, and click **Allow to confirm**. Finally, install Consent-O-Matic by clicking **Add to Chrome** (Fig. 1) and then clicking on **Add** when prompted.

Upon successful installation a notification appears on the top-right corner, and the Consent-O-Matic icon is added to your toolbar. When you visit a website that requires your consent for tracking, Consent-O-Matic automatically fills the form according to your privacy preferences. If you wish to disable the add-on for the current website you are browsing, you can do so by clicking the add-on icon and then unticking the option under **Keep running on this site?**  (Fig. 2).

By default, Consent-O-Matic sets your privacy preferences to not consent to any tracking. If you wish to change this, you can do so by toggling the appropriate category(s) in the settings page.
