Instagram - Blocking users

# Summary #
This guide will take you through the few steps you need to take if you want to block an account on Instagram.

# Body #

Blocking an account on Instagram will make them unable to find your profile, stories and posts. When you block a profile, they do not get a notification about your action. Blocking an account means you will stop getting notifications from that same account and it also means you cannot follow an account you have blocked. Keep in mind that if your profile is set to public, anyone that you have blocked can find you if they login through another account.

**On the mobile app or on your browser** (procedure is exactly the same):

* Go to the profile you wish to block.
* Click the three dots on the top right corner, select Block and then confirm.
