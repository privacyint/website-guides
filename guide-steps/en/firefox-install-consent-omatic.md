Install an automatic consent pop-up filler on Firefox - Consent-O-Matic

# Summary #
Consent-O-Matic is a browser add-on used to automatically answer consent pop-ups for you, according to your privacy preferences. In this guide, you'll learn how to install Consent-O-Matic on Firefox.

# Body #
In some locations, websites are required by law to ask you for consent if they want to collect data that can be used to track you. This has become a general practice across the web, and the typical way to ask for consent is by using pop-ups, sometimes with sketchy options to misguide you into giving consent. Consent-O-Matic is a browser add-on that allows you to set your privacy preferences, and then answers consent forms for you according to those preferences when they pop-up. This way, you ensure your privacy preferences are preserved while browsing the web, without the need to manually parse and fill consent forms.

This guide explains how to install Consent-O-Matic on Firefox.

### Installation ###
Like any other add-on, install Consent-O-Matic by visiting the [Mozilla Firefox Add-ons page][1] and clicking **Add to Firefox** (Fig. 1) and then clicking on **Add** when prompted (Fig. 2).

Upon successful installation a notification appears on the top-right corner, and the Consent-O-Matic icon is added to your toolbar (Fig. 3). When you visit a website that requires your consent for tracking, Consent-O-Matic automatically fills the form according to your privacy preferences. If you wish to disable the add-on for the current website you are browsing, you can do so by clicking the add-on icon and then unticking the option under **Keep running on this site?**  (Fig. 4).

By default, Consent-O-Matic sets your privacy preferences to not consent to any tracking. If you wish to change this, you can do so by toggling the appropriate category(s) in the settings page.
