Safari includes several features, such as displaying search suggestions, meant to improve your browsing experience that require you to share data with third-parties. You can disable these options by going to the **Search** pane, and disabling **Include search engine suggestions**, **Include Safari sugestions**, and **Preload Top Hit in the background**.

To prevent websites from tracking you, go to the **Privacy** pane and enable **Prevent cross-site tracking** and **Hide IP address from trackers**. You can also block all cookies to prevent tracking, but beware that this can interfere with your web browsing experience.
