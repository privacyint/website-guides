# Viber - Good Practices

Settings can only do so much to protect you. Your security and privacy also comes from how you use the app. This guides covers short concrete advice on good practices to follow when using this app.


* From time to time, clear any inactive Viber sessions by going to **Settings > Account > Desktop and Tablets.**
* If a stranger starts a conversation with you claiming to be someone you know try to ensure that they are who they claim they are before providing any information about yourself
* Joining a group will make your phone number visible to all group members. Before joining a group we recommend you to be careful as to who might access this information
* Messaging apps such as Viber can be used to send malicious code and links.
* We caution you against any engaging with unexpected contacts, and any files and links sent to you. This includes considering carefully whether to download or open any files over messaging apps, or clicking on links.
