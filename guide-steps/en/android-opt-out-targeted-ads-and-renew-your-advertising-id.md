Opt out of targeted ads and renew your Advertising ID on Android

# Summary #
Android offers a way for advertisers to uniquely identify you in order to track your activity across applications and websites you access on your mobile device. In this guide you'll learn how to hinder tracking on your Android device either by periodically resetting your Ad ID or by opting out completely.

# Body #
The Advertising ID is a [unique identifier native to the Android Operating System](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en-GB) that advertisers might use to uniquely identify you. It facilitates the creation of profiles by advertisers or data brokers that can later be used for advertisement targeting or other purposes.


> **Warning**: Android settings may be placed on different menus depending on the distribution you are running. In which case, you can use the search feature to quickly find the settings mentioned in this guide.
