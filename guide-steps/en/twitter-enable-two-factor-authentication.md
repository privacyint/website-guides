# Title
Twitter (X) - Enable Two-factor authentication

# Summary

Two-factor authentication ensures that your account is not accessed even if your username and password have been stolen. This greatly improves your account security. Learn how to enable it on Twitter (X).

# Body

We suggest using Two-factor authentication, as it provides an extra security step in order to access your account. This way, when you connect, Twitter (X) will verify your identity by requesting a code in addition to your username and password.

This code (the second factor) can be received either by SMS, an app, or a security key. Note that by default Twitter (X) forces you to use a phone number to receive an SMS. You can later enable Two-factor authentication with an app and remove the SMS option.

In the settings page, click **Privacy and safety > Security and account access > Security > Two-factor authentication** and follow the instructions in [this page](1).
