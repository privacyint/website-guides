# Title #
A guide to getting your data from Uber

# Summary #
This cloud guide enables you to obtain the data stored about you and to limit the amount of data being collected by the Uber app.

# Body #
Your Uber app stores a lot of information in the cloud. Here we show you how you can get access to it.

It's important to understand how much of your data is stored in the cloud. Why? Because our [research](https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3300/cloud-extraction-technology-secret-tech-lets-government-agencies-collect-masses-data) exposes that law enforcement can use cloud extraction techniques to obtain vast quantities of your data. These techniques means law enforcement can circumvent asking companies like Uber for your data and avoid getting a warrant. So the use of this technology means there is no limit on what they can obtain, no transparency and no clear, accessible or effective legal safeguards to protect your data from risk of abuse and misuse.

In the past, we've [contacted Uber](https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/3302/big-tech-companies-must-protect-customer-data-legal-backdoors) who have not provided us with a response to date. 

When customers use the Uber app, the details of each trip are stored. If this data is accessed by law enforcment agencies without any limit they will have knowledge of ALL addresses that the person has recently visited by Uber. With no limit on what they can obtain, they can collect and store data that is irrelevant to an investigation.

Cellebrite states that their [UFED Cloud Analyzer 7.6 supports](https://www.cellebrite.com/en/productupdates/retrieve-digital-evidence-from-drones-routers-the-uber-app-mobile-web-browsers-and-more/) extraction from the Uber app and is able to
> "gain passenger and driver profile data, pick-up and drop-off location logs, and the last 4 digits of a user’s credit card...retrieval of .... Credit card details that new users are required to fill in on their first login. As the passenger chooses their pickup location, desired destination and available driver, each journey is well documented. Recorded routes are aggregated and then categorized by favourite destinations. The driver’s information includes the name and photo identification."

Your location and travel data can be very revealing. For example, your visits to religious buildings can indicate your religion to law enforcement and potentially lead to you being profiled. 

In the context of the Coronavirus pandemic, the data obtained from Uber may be used to track if you have been breaking social distancing measures. If you have taken an Uber to a GP/hospital, inferences can be drawn regarding your health. 

This cloud guide enables you to obtain the data stored about you and to limit the amount of data being collected.

Once you have completed the verification process, you will need to click on **Request a copy of your Uber data** one last time. Afterwards, you will receive a confirmation of your request which will look like this:

When you select **Location** you will be able to change the location data you share with Uber. You can switch it off completely.

If you switch off the location tracking, you will still be able to use Uber, but you will have to enter pickup and drop off addresses manually. The data can still be collected from the driver's device. However it will not be stored in your account.

Please note, you will NOT be able to use Uber 'Bikes' or 'Scooter' options if your location services are disabled.
