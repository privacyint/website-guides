# Title #
A guide to getting your data from Uber

# Summary #
This guide enables you to obtain the data stored about you and to limit the amount of data being collected by the Uber app.

# Body #

Your Uber app generates a lot of data that is stored in the app and shared with Uber.

It’s important for you to be able to understand the types of data that apps like Uber’s generate. Government agencies may seek access to this data through at least two routes: they could directly access your device and then analyse the data stored in the app and data your app shares and can access on Uber’s servers (and potentially data backed-up to your cloud provider) using ‘cloud extraction’ techniques, or they may request your data from the service provider directly.

When customers use the Uber app, the details of each trip are stored. If this data is accessed by law enforcement agencies without any limit they will have knowledge of ALL addresses that the person has recently visited by Uber. With no limit on what they can obtain, they can collect and store data that is irrelevant to an investigation.

Cellebrite states that their [UFED Cloud Analyzer 7.6 supports](https://www.cellebrite.com/en/productupdates/retrieve-digital-evidence-from-drones-routers-the-uber-app-mobile-web-browsers-and-more/) extraction from the Uber app and is able to
> "gain passenger and driver profile data, pick-up and drop-off location logs, and the last 4 digits of a user’s credit card...retrieval of .... Credit card details that new users are required to fill in on their first login. As the passenger chooses their pickup location, desired destination and available driver, each journey is well documented. Recorded routes are aggregated and then categorized by favourite destinations. The driver’s information includes the name and photo identification."

Your location and travel data can be very revealing. For example, visits to religious buildings can indicate your religion to government agencies and potentially lead to you being profiled. 

In the context of the Coronavirus pandemic, the data obtained from Uber may be used to track if you have been breaking social distancing measures. If you have taken an Uber to a GP/hospital, inferences can be drawn regarding your health. 

This guide enables you to obtain the data stored about you and to limit the amount of data being collected. 

**How to find out what data Uber stores about you**

Open your Uber app. Press the button on the top left and then select **Help**. Then, scroll down to the **All Topics** section and select the option **A guide to Uber**.

This will then exit the Uber app and open a new window in your internet browser. You will be required to log into your Uber account. Once you have completed the verification process, you will need to click on **Request a copy of your Uber data** one last time. Afterwards, you will receive a confirmation of your request which will look like this:

You will also receive confirmation to your registered email account that your data request is being prepared and will take a couple of days:

**How to limit the data accessible to Uber**

The only way to limit your data being stored is to switch off location tracking option. It may be good practice to turn this off as it’s not always clear if and when and what granularity of location data is shared with an app. To do this, click on the account button in the top left corner. Select **Settings**, and then select **Privacy Settings**

After this, select **Location** as in the image below:

When you select **Location** you will be able to change the location data you share with Uber. You can switch it off completely.

If you switch off the location tracking, you will still be able to use Uber, but you will have to enter pickup and drop off addresses manually. The data can still be collected from the driver's device. However it will not be stored in your account.

Please note, you will NOT be able to use Uber 'Bikes' or 'Scooter' options if your location services are disabled.
