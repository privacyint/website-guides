### Tracking prevention ###
Edge includes a basic tracking protection mechanism to prevent trackers from collecting data about you. To enable this mechanism, go to the **Tracking prevention** pane, and select **Balanced** protection (Fig. 2). You can also choose Strict protection, but beware this may make some webpages not fully display and work as intended.

### Privacy ###
Do Not Track (DNT) is a signal that your browser broadcasts to websites you are visiting stating that you do not want to be tracked. Not all websites respect this but some do, so you might want to enable it nonetheless. For more protection, refer to [our guide on installing an ad-blocker](edge-ublock-origin.md). 

To enable DNT, go to the **Privacy** pane and enable **Send "Do Not Track" requests** (Fig. 3).

### Sharing diagnostic data ###
Similarly to other browser, the Edge browser collects diagnostics data to improve its service. This data can be revealing (inclduing websites you visited) and you might want to avoid sharing it. To prevent the data collection from happening, you can go to the **Optional diagnostic data** pane, and disable **Help improve Microsoft products by sending optional diagnostics data about how you use the browser, websites you visit, and crash reports** (Fig. 4). from online trackers.

### Personalized web experience ###
To prevent Microsoft from [serving you ads based on your web browsing habits](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-edge/microsoft-edge-browsing-activity-for-personalized-advertising-and-experiences-37aa831e-6372-238e-f33f-7cd3f0e53679), go to the **Personalize your web experience** pane and disable **Improve your web experience by allowing Microsoft to use your browsing history from this account for personalizing advertising, search, news and other Microsoft services** (Fig. 5).

### Services ###

Microsoft Edge uses web services to improve your browsing experience. To do so, it may share your personal data with Microsoft. If you are not comfortable with this, you can prevent such data sharing: go to the **Services** pane, and disable all options (Fig. 6). Then, click on **Address bar and search** and disable both options (Fig. 7).
