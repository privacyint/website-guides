Like other tech platforms, TikTok (which is owned by ByteDance) makes most of its [money from advertising](http://digiday.com/media/everything-you-need-to-know-about-bytedance-the-company-behind-tiktok/). TikTok allows advertisers [to target ads](/node/3703) on the basis of custom or lookalike audiences, namely targeting users on the basis of pre-defined characteristics.

The screenshots below outline some of the steps you can take to minimise the data you share on TikTok.

1. Once signed into the app, click on the three bars in the upper right-hand corner.
